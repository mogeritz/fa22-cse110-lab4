## Q3:
`values added: 20`
## Q4:
The code throws an error, as `result` is not defined. Because we declared it using `let`, it went out of scope after the if block, thus not beeing available outside of it.
## Q5:
The code returns an error trying to assign a new value to `result`, thus not reaching this point. If it did, it would return `values added: 0`.
## Q6
See Q5, would return `final result: 0`.
